## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Host-side state machine (`HostState`) with validated transitions, timing history, and structured perf logging
- Per-state message validation: host validates both outbound and inbound vsock control messages against lifecycle stage
- New Tauri IPC commands for Svelte UI: `get_guest_config`, `get_network_policy`, `set_guest_env`, `remove_guest_env`, `get_vm_state`
- Structured `vm-state-changed` events with JSON payloads (state + trigger) instead of plain strings
- Protocol documentation (`docs/protocol.md`): wire format, message reference, state machine diagrams, boot handshake, security invariants
- Zero-trust guest binary security rule documented in `docs/security.md`
- `write_policy_file()` for TOML serialization of user.toml changes from the UI
- MITM transparent proxy: full HTTP inspection (method, path, status code, headers, body preview) for all HTTPS traffic from the guest VM
- Static Capsem MITM CA certificate (ECDSA P-256, 100-year validity) baked into the guest rootfs trust store
- On-demand domain certificate minting with RwLock cache for TLS termination
- HTTP-level policy engine: method+path rules on top of domain allow/block lists (`[[network.rules]]` in user.toml)
- Extended telemetry: `web.db` now records HTTP method, path, status code, request/response headers, and body previews
- CA trust environment variables (`REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`) injected via BootConfig
- certifi CA bundle patching in rootfs for Python SDK compatibility (requests, openai, anthropic)
- Schema migration for existing `web.db` databases (adds new columns without data loss)
- Clock synchronization -- guest VM clock is set from host at boot time (fixes TLS cert validation, git, curl)
- Environment variable injection via vsock boot config (`BootConfig`/`BootReady` handshake)
- `[guest]` section in `user.toml` for custom guest environment variables
- `--env KEY=VALUE` CLI flag for one-off env injection (`capsem --env FOO=bar echo $FOO`)
- `capsem-proto` crate -- shared protocol types for host/guest communication
- Clock sync diagnostic test in `capsem-doctor`
- In-VM diagnostic test suite expanded: MITM CA trust chain tests (system store, certifi, curl without -k, Python urllib), network edge cases (HTTP port 80, non-443 ports, direct IP, AI provider blocking, multi-domain DNS), process integrity (pty-agent, dnsmasq, no systemd/sshd/cron), deeper kernel hardening (no modules loaded, no debugfs, no IPv6, no swap, no kallsyms, ro cmdline), environment validation (TERM, HOME, PATH, arch, kernel version, mount points), and 14 additional unix utility checks
- `just test` recipe runs workspace tests with coverage summary via `cargo-llvm-cov`
- `just ensure-tools` auto-installs `cargo-llvm-cov` and `llvm-tools-preview` on fresh clones
- Air-gapped networking: `curl https://elie.net` now works from inside the guest VM
- Host-side SNI proxy inspects TLS ClientHello, enforces domain allow-list, and bridges to the real internet
- Domain policy engine with allow-list, block-list, and wildcard pattern matching (`*.github.com`)
- Configurable domain policy via `~/.capsem/user.toml` and `/etc/capsem/corp.toml` (corp overrides user)
- Per-session `web.db` (SQLite) recording every HTTPS connection attempt for auditing
- Guest-side `capsem-net-proxy` binary: TCP-to-vsock relay for transparent HTTPS proxying
- Default developer allow-list: GitHub, npm, PyPI, crates.io, Debian repos, elie.net
- AI provider domain blocking at SNI level (api.anthropic.com, api.openai.com, googleapis.com)
- `net_events` Tauri command for querying recent network events from the frontend
- Per-VM network isolation: each VM gets its own policy, web.db, and connection handlers

### Changed
- SNI proxy replaced by MITM transparent proxy for full HTTP-level traffic inspection and policy enforcement
- Domain policy (`DomainPolicy`) wrapped by `HttpPolicy` which adds method+path rules while preserving backward compatibility
- `load_merged_policy()` now returns `HttpPolicy` instead of `DomainPolicy`
- HTTPS proxy connections spawn as async tokio tasks instead of blocking threads
- Control protocol split into disjoint `HostToGuest`/`GuestToHost` enums with reserved variants for file operations and lifecycle management
- Guest agent boot sequence restructured: vsock connects first, receives clock + env from host before forking bash
- Max control frame size bumped from 4KB to 8KB to accommodate env var payloads
- `just build`, `just repack`, and `just check` now run tests with coverage as a gate before proceeding
- Kernel now includes IP stack + netfilter (CONFIG_INET=y, iptables REDIRECT) for air-gapped networking
- Rootfs includes iproute2, iptables, and dnsmasq for guest network setup
- capsem-init sets up dummy0 NIC, fake DNS, and iptables rules at boot
- `just repack` now includes `capsem-net-proxy` alongside `capsem-pty-agent`
- Refactored VM smoke test into pytest-based diagnostic suite (`capsem-doctor`)
- Split tests into focused modules: sandbox security, utilities, runtimes, AI CLIs, workflows
- Added sandbox security tests (rootfs read-only, no kernel modules, no /dev/mem, network isolation, no setuid/setgid)
- Added Python and Node.js execution tests (actual code runs, not just version checks)
- Added AI CLI sandbox verification (binaries execute without crashing)
- Network sandbox tests updated: verify air-gapped proxy (allowed/denied domains) instead of raw network block

### Fixed
- MITM proxy TLS handshake failure: rustls crypto provider was not initialized, causing silent panics on every proxy connection
- MITM proxy now uses explicit `builder_with_provider()` instead of relying on global crypto state, eliminating the class of bug entirely
- `just build` failure: Dockerfile.rootfs could not find CA cert (build context was `images/`, cert was in `config/`)
- `just build` failure: certifi not installed when CA bundle patching step runs
- Kernel `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=n` was silently ignored because the option requires `CONFIG_EXPERT=y` to be configurable
- Kernel cmdline now includes `ro` for read-only rootfs mount
- `just smoke-test` now returns non-zero exit code on test failures
- In-VM diagnostic test fixes: `/proc/modules` absent is valid (CONFIG_MODULES=n), bash test checks availability not current shell, CA bundle tests grep base64 instead of DER-encoded CN, Python TLS test verifies handshake not HTTP status

### Deprecated
- `sni_proxy::handle_connection` -- use `mitm_proxy::handle_connection` for full HTTP inspection

### Security
- `CONFIG_EXPERT=y` in kernel defconfig ensures all hardening options (KALLSYMS=n, MODULES=n, etc.) are respected by `make olddefconfig`
- Kernel symbol table (`/proc/kallsyms`) now empty -- eliminates kernel ASLR bypass vector
- MITM proxy enables full HTTP audit trail: every request method, path, status code, and headers are logged to web.db
- HTTP-level policy rules allow fine-grained control (e.g., allow GET but deny POST to specific paths)
- Default-deny domain policy: only explicitly allowed domains are reachable from the guest
- No DNS leaves the VM: all resolution is faked to a local IP
- Corporate policy (`/etc/capsem/corp.toml`) overrides user settings for enterprise lockdown
- Per-VM isolation prevents cross-VM network interference

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- PTY-over-vsock terminal communication replacing serial broadcast channel
- Guest PTY agent (`capsem-pty-agent`) for high-throughput terminal I/O with full PTY support
- Terminal resize support (`stty size` reflects window dimensions)
- vsock control channel with MessagePack framing for structured commands (resize, heartbeat)
- Kernel vsock support (`CONFIG_VSOCKETS`, `CONFIG_VIRTIO_VSOCKETS`)
- Multi-VM-ready app state architecture (`vm_id`-keyed `HashMap`)
- Output coalescing (10ms/64KB) to prevent frontend IPC saturation
- Boot-time command execution via vsock (`Exec`/`ExecDone` control messages)
- CLI mode (`capsem "command"`) routes commands through vsock PTY agent with exit code propagation

### Changed
- Terminal input now routes through vsock when connected, falling back to serial
- Guest init script (`capsem-init`) launches PTY agent instead of direct bash/setsid
- CLI mode rewritten from serial I/O to vsock-based execution with proper exit codes
- `just repack` now cross-compiles and bundles the PTY agent into the initrd for fast iteration
- Serial forwarding stops once vsock connects, eliminating duplicate output
- M5 redesigned: zero-trust network boundaries with SNI proxy domain filtering, AI provider domain blocking, and real-time file telemetry via fanotify
- M6 redesigned: active AI audit gateway with 9-stage event lifecycle (PII scrubbing, tool call interception, secret scanning), replaces passive proxy approach
- M7 redesigned: hybrid MCP architecture -- local tools run sandboxed in-VM, remote tools route through host gateway with credential injection
- M8 redesigned: per-session audit databases with zstd-compressed blobs, OverlayFS config write-back, enterprise observability (Prometheus, OTLP, corporate policy via MDM)

### Fixed
- Shell prompt not appearing after command execution (stderr was redirected to /dev/hvc0, sending readline prompt through buffered serial path instead of vsock PTY)

### Security
- Removed serial console fallback: missing PTY agent halts boot instead of opening an unprotected shell
- Replaced scattered `unsafe { File::from_raw_fd }` + `mem::forget` with centralized `borrow_fd` helper using `ManuallyDrop`
- Added T13 threat (AI Traffic Audit Bypass) documenting the enforcement chain: iptables -> vsock bridge -> SNI proxy -> audit gateway
- Updated T3 (Data Exfiltration) with fswatch telemetry, PII engine, and secret scanning mitigations
- Updated T5 (Credential Theft) with gateway key injection and PII scrubbing on model calls
- Updated T11 (Network Exfiltration) with AI domain blocking at SNI proxy and 9-stage lifecycle enforcement
- Added Corporate Security Profile section with MDM-distributable policy.toml for enterprise deployments
